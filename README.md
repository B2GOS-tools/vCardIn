vCard Importer
==============

A basic FirefoxOS app importer for contacts from a vCard file

This project is just starting.

TODO:

- Field to specify the path of the file inside the SDCARD (root by default)
- User interface (and some beatiful icons -Pablo Massa?-)
- Tests
- Refactoring (make the code a little nicer)
- Publishing on Firefox Marketplace (for free, of course)
- Define a License (MIT? GNU?)
